	<p>This blog details the data science projects undertaken by Yixuan, also known as @tamagoniisan (instagram handle).
		On top of thinking of the kind of world problems that data can bring insights for, Yixuan also enjoys playing the piano,
		casual gaming, and cooking egg dishes. He also tends to litter his instagram feed with lots of cute puppies, kittens,
		and micro piglets.</p>
	<p>Not much was known about how Yixuan started his data journey, but it was partially through having a tiny hand on the
		power of data, plus the exposure brought about industry players no doubt trying to drum up what they term the seeming
		lack of supply of Data Scientists in the world. He started small - creating his own formulas to navigate the
		confusing quotations given by forwarders, to helping and encouraging his co-workers to do the same to improve on their
		work. It wasn't his main job scope then, so he went on to find other work which included his friend's own business. On
		top of that, he was also learning python on the side.</p>
		<p>Not long after, Yixuan knew what he really wanted to do in life, and also realised that in this data journey he needed
			more time and motivation. As such, he made a leap of faith and resigned from his company, but it was only a little
			later that he would start studying full time (due to various reasons, of course!)</p>
